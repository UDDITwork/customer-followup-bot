# 🚀 Quick Start Guide

## Step 1: Start the Backend

```bash
cd backend
python -m uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

You should see:
```
[SUCCESS] Database schema initialized successfully
[SUCCESS] Application started in LOCAL mode
[INFO] Email mode: Mock (Development)
INFO:     Uvicorn running on http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

The backend is now running at **http://localhost:8000**

## Step 2: Test the API

Open **http://localhost:8000/docs** in your browser to see the interactive API documentation.

Or test with curl:
```bash
curl http://localhost:8000/
```

You should see:
```json
{
  "message": "Customer Quote Request API",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "environment": "local",
  "email_mode": "development"
}
```

## Step 3: Send a Test Email

### Option A: Using FastAPI Docs (Easiest!)

1. Go to http://localhost:8000/docs
2. Find `POST /dev/receive-email`
3. Click "Try it out"
4. Paste this JSON:

```json
{
  "from_email": "john.smith@example.com",
  "subject": "Quote Request for Dell Laptops",
  "body": "Hi,\n\nI need a quote for Dell Latitude 5430 laptops.\n\nDetails:\n- Model: Dell Latitude 5430\n- RAM: 16GB\n- Storage: 512GB SSD\n- Screen: 14-inch FHD\n- Warranty: 3-year\n- Quantity: 25 units\n- Delivery: 123 Main St, New York, NY 10001\n- Timeline: Need by March 15, 2026\n\nBest regards,\nJohn Smith"
}
```

5. Click "Execute"
6. Check the response!

### Option B: Using curl

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/dev/receive-email \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "from_email": "john.smith@example.com",
    "subject": "Quote Request",
    "body": "I need 25 Dell Latitude laptops with 16GB RAM, 512GB SSD, 14-inch screen, 3-year warranty. Deliver to NYC by March 15, 2026."
  }'
```

## Step 4: View the Created Ticket

```bash
# Get all tickets
curl http://localhost:8000/tickets/

# Get sent emails (follow-ups generated by the system)
curl http://localhost:8000/dev/sent-emails
```

## Step 5: Start the Frontend (Optional)

In a new terminal:

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open **http://localhost:5173** to see the dashboard!

## What Just Happened?

1. ✅ You sent a test email to the system
2. ✅ Claude AI extracted the quote details (customer name, laptop specs, quantity, delivery info)
3. ✅ A ticket was created in the Turso database
4. ✅ If information was missing, a follow-up email was generated (check `/dev/sent-emails`)

## Next Steps

- Try sending emails with missing information
- Simulate customer replies using `in_reply_to` parameter
- View tickets in the React dashboard
- Read the full README.md for production deployment

## Troubleshooting

**Backend won't start?**
- Make sure port 8000 is free
- Check that Python 3.10+ is installed
- Verify `.env.local` exists in the `backend/` directory

**Dependencies missing?**
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt --user
```

**Database errors?**
- Check your Turso credentials in `.env.local`
- Verify you have internet connection (Turso is cloud-hosted)
